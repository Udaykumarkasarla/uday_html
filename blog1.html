            <h2>Brain Stroke Detection with AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This project focuses on using AI and machine learning to predict brain strokes early, helping doctors provide timely treatment and saving lives.</p>

                <strong>Content:</strong> 
                In my Brain Stroke Detection project, I explored the use of various machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest to classify patients based on risk factors such as age, hypertension, and heart disease. The model was trained on a dataset of medical records, aiming to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring.
                <br><br>
                By improving the model's accuracy, healthcare professionals can receive valuable insights for early detection and prevention. This project not only challenged me to apply AI techniques but also deepened my understanding of healthcare applications in machine learning.

      <h2>Lung Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning</h2>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This project leverages machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection of lung cancer, potentially saving lives through timely intervention.</p>
      <img src="lung.jpg" alt="Lung Cancer Detection Model" height="400" width="600">
      <p>
          <strong>Content:</strong> 
          In this project, I developed a predictive model for lung cancer detection by analyzing medical images and patient data. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification and decision trees for analyzing risk factors like smoking history, age, and genetic predisposition, the model aims to detect early signs of lung cancer.
          <br>
          By focusing on high-risk individuals and detecting cancer at an early stage, the model enhances diagnosis accuracy and provides valuable insights to healthcare providers. This project not only expanded my skills in image processing and data analytics but also demonstrated the potential of AI to transform the field of medical diagnostics.
